# SQL_DB_Analysis

Analysing  a SQL database.

Starting of with some simple select statements 

 - Count of rows in products table.sql
 - Selecting top 5 rows.sql


I then created a new table 

- New Table.sql

I then moved on to answer the following bussiness questions: 

 - Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of? 
 - Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
 - Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?


 # Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?

From Q1.sql shows which products are the lowest on stock limited to 10.

From Q1.2.sql Shows which products perfmored the most using a SUM caluculation to work out the amount of money coming in.

The results from these queries shows that classic cars are the priority for restocking. They sell frequently, and they are the highest-performance products.



 # Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?


VIP Customers.sql shows the top 5 customers where the highest amount of profit is made. 

New Customers Each Month.sql shows over time the amount of new customers. 

Least Engaged Customers.sql shows the bottom 5 customers with the lowest amount of profit.

These results show the most-important and least-committed customers, we can determine how to drive loyalty and attract more customers.


 # Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

AVG.sql shows the average profit made. 

LTV tells us how much profit an average customer generates during their lifetime with our store. We can use it to predict our future profit. So, if we get ten new customers next month, we'll earn 390,395 dollars, and we can decide based on this prediction how much we can spend on acquiring new customers.
